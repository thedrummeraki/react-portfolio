This is [Akinyele.ca](https://www.akinyele.ca), this is my site.

## What is it?

After my amazing internship at Shopify, I learned this beautiful
JavaScript library called [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

I decided to put my skills to the test and learn more.

## How was it built?

I started this with `create-react-app`. Turns out this was exactly
what I needed to get started with a React project.

I divided each component into its repective category:

- The stateful scenes (has many sections)
- The sections (has many containers and/or components)
- The stateful containers (though I don't have any) (has other components)
- The stateless components (may have other components)

Since my version of React is quite new, I dicided to give [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
a shot.

## Is this my first site?

TLDR; **This is the third version of my website.**.

My [older website](https://github.com/thedrummeraki/old.akinyele.ca) made in 2017 uses Ruby on Rails 
in the backend and [MaterializeCSS](materializecss.com) on the front end. 
I relied on this site for over 2 years. Managing the projects on the database
because rather... cumbersome.

Before that I made a Node.js website. I was just learning about JavaScript at
that time (that would have been in 2016). So I overdid it with JavaScript and
literally used JavaScript for **everything** - except for CSS ;). This made
the site impossible to manage. Looking back, it looks like I was trying to
achieve what React does without knowing... and that didn't work out very
well.
